# Whisper Transcribe

Welcome to the Whisper Transcribe repository. This is a simple Python
command line application that allows you to record audio and transcribe it using one of the
[Whisper ASR models by OpenAI](https://openai.com/research/whisper). It uses a terminal user interface, making it easy to use.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.10 or higher (probably works with lower versions, but not tested)
* ffmpeg
